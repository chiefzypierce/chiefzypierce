hello! I'm missa, but some of my friends know me with other names as well. (clown & lico mostly)
my pronouns are they/it and im 18!

some of the things i like: lifesteal, thatchiefguy, somewhat of an unstable universe, cookie run, stardew valley, splatoon, project sekai. there's definitely more but these seem most important and/or popular.

im very awkward and tend to be silent when i interact with people unless i am with my friends, im sorry if you interact with me lmao
